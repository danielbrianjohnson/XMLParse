# XMLParse
Generic XML Parse - Python

Load really simple syndication feed (RSS feed - simple text files with basic updated information) from specified URL and save it as an XML file.
Parse the XML file to save as a list of dictionaries where each dictionary is a single item.
Save the items into a CSV file.

Still need to do some investation on doing without built in libraries. They are not installed on all machines
